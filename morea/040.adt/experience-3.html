  <h2 id="homework-problems">Homework Problems</h2>

<p><em>There are 6 problems for a total of 20 points. Most of them are easier than
they look at first.</em></p>

<p><em>Please consider:</em> The homework is really “worth” a lot more than 20 points
because exams have similar problems. If you have not practiced with the
homeworks, you’ll do worse on the exams. So, if you think these problems are
not worth the time for the points, think again.</p>

<h3 id="peer-credit-assignment">#1. Peer Credit Assignment</h3>

<h4 id="point-extra-credit-for-replying">1 Point Extra Credit for replying</h4>

<p>Please list the names of the other members of your peer group for this week
and the number of extra credit points you think they deserve for their
participation in group work on Tuesday and Thursday combined.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If three members besides yourself were present at some time, you have a total of 3 points to allocate.</li>
  <li>If only two members besides yourself were present, you have a total of 4 points to allocate.</li>
  <li>If only one other member was present, you have a total of 6 points to allocate.</li>
  <li>You need not allocate all the points available to you. Points allocated to yourself will not be recorded.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="proving-asymptotic-complexity">#2. Proving asymptotic complexity</h3>

<h4 id="points">4 points</h4>

<p>Using the truth-condition definition of big-O, prove that 3_n_2 + 9 =
O(_n_2).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The definition is the one that starts with “<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = O(<em>g</em>(<em>n</em>)) iff …”.
You will have to choose suitable <em>c</em> and <em>n_0, plug them into the definition
in “…”, and argue that the condition is met.<br />
The 4 points are: (1) identification of _c</em> and <em>n_0 that work; (1) writing
out the definition, and (2) demonstrating that it is satsified as _n</em> grows
beyond <em>n_0 (not just for _n</em> = _n_0).</p>

<p>Continuing in the style of Tuesday’s class exercise, fill in the table for
these pairs of functions with “Yes” or “No” in each empty box. Then, for each
row, justify your choice, preferably by showing mathematical relationships
(e.g., transforming one expression into another, or into expressions that are
more easily compared).</p>

<h3 id="complexity-of-dynamic-set-operations-in-list-implementations">#4. Complexity of Dynamic Set Operations in List Implementations</h3>

<h4 id="points-2">2 points</h4>

<p>For each of the four types of lists in the following table, what is the
asymptotic worst-case running time for <code>predecessor</code> and <code>maximum</code>?</p>

<p>Assume that <em>k</em> is the key, <em>d</em> the data associated with the key, and <em>p</em> a
position in the data structure. This version of the ADT is similar to the
book’s, but abstracts list elements <em>x</em> to positions (returned by search).
<code>predecessor</code> and <code>maximum</code> are with respect to ordering of keys in the set
under “&lt;”, NOT ordering of the data structure. Sorted lists are sorted in
ascending order. This continues your in-class work, which you may want to
review for correctness first.</p>

<h3 id="tree-traversals">#5. Tree Traversals</h3>

<h4 id="points-3">4 points</h4>

<p><em>In class you wrote a recursive procedure for traversal of a binary tree in
O(n) time, printing out the keys of the nodes. Here you write two other tree
traversal procedures. The first is a variation of what you wrote in class; the
second is on a different kind of tree that you read about pages 248-249 and in
my lecture notes and screencast.</em></p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Write an O(<em>n</em>)-time <strong><em>non-recursive</em></strong> procedure that, given an <em>n</em>-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node of the tree in whatever order you wish. Assume that trees consist of vertices of class <code>TreeNode</code> with instance variables <code>parent</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>key</code>. Your procedure takes a <code>TreeNode</code> as its argument (the root of the tree). <strong><em>Use a stack as an auxiliary data structure.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>printBinaryTreeNodes(TreeNode root) {
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Write an O(<em>n</em>)-time procedure that, given an <em>n</em>-node rooted tree with <strong><em>arbitrary</em></strong> number of children using the <strong><em>left-child, right-sibling representation</em></strong>, prints out the key of each node of the tree in whatever order you wish. Assume that for economy of code we are re-using our <code>TreeNode</code> class. The instance variable <code>left</code> points to the left child as before, but now <code>right</code> points to the right sibling instead of the right child (which is no longer unique). Your procedure takes a <code>TreeNode</code> as its argument (the root of the tree). You may choose to use either the recursive or non-recursive approach.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>printLCRSTreeNodes(TreeNode root) {
</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-hybrid-mergeinsertion-sort-algorithm">#6. A Hybrid Merge/Insertion Sort Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="points-4">7 points</h4>

<p>Although MergeSort runs in Θ(<em>n</em> lg <em>n</em>) worst-case time and InsertionSort
runs in Θ(_n_2) worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort
(including that fact that it can sort in-place) can make it faster in practice
for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to
<strong><em>coarsen</em></strong> the leaves of the MergeSort recursion tree by using
InsertionSort within MergeSort when subproblems become sufficiently small.</p>

<p>Consider a modification to MergeSort in which <em>n</em>/<em>k</em> sublists of length <em>k</em>
are sorted using InsertionSort and are then merged using the standard merging
mechanism, where <em>k</em> is a value to be determined in this problem. In the first
two parts of the problem, we get expressions for the contributions of
InsertionSort and MergeSort to the total runtime as a function of the input
size <em>n</em> and the cutoff point between the algorithms <em>k</em>.</p>

<p><strong>(a - 1pt)</strong> Show that InsertionSort can sort the <em>n</em>/<em>k</em> sublists, each of length <em>k</em>, in Θ(<em>nk</em>) worst-case time. To do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>write the cost for sorting <em>k</em> items with InsertionSort,</li>
  <li>multiply by how many times you have to do it, and </li>
  <li>show that the expression you get simplifies to Θ(<em>nk</em>).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(b - 3pts)</strong> Show that MergeSort can merge the <em>n</em>/<em>k</em> sublists of size <em>k</em> in Θ(<em>n</em> lg (<em>n</em>/<em>k</em>)) worst-case time. To do this: </p>

<ol>
  <li>draw the recursion tree for the merge (a modification of figure 2.5), </li>
  <li>determine how many elements are merged at each level, </li>
  <li>determine the height of the recursion tree from the <em>n</em>/<em>k</em> lists that InsertionSort had already taken care of up to the single list that results at the end, and </li>
  <li>show how you get the final expression Θ(<em>n</em> lg (<em>n</em>/<em>k</em>)) from these two values. </li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>Putting it together:</strong></em> The asymptotic runtime of the hybrid algorithm is
the sum of the two expressions above: the cost to sort the <em>n</em>/<em>k</em> sublists of
size <em>k</em>, and the cost to divide and merge them. You have just shown this to
be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Θ(<em>n__k</em> + <em>n</em> lg (<em>n</em>/<em>k</em>))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the second two parts of the question we explore what <em>k</em> can be.</p>

<p><strong>(c - 2pts)</strong> The bigger we make <em>k</em> the bigger lists InsertionSort has to sort. At some point, its Θ(<em>n_2) growth will overcome the advantage it has over MergeSort in lower constant overhead. How big can _k</em> get before InsertionSort starts slowing things down? Derive a theoretical answer by proving the largest value of <em>k</em> for which the hybrid sort has the same Θ runtime as a standard Θ(<em>n</em> lg <em>n</em>) MergeSort. This will be an upper bound on <em>k</em>. To do this: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Looking at the expression for the hybrid algorithm runtime Θ(<em>n__k</em> + <em>n</em> lg (<em>n</em>/<em>k</em>)), identify the upper bound on <em>k</em> expressed as a function of <em>n</em>, above which Θ(<em>n__k</em> + <em>n</em> lg (<em>n</em>/<em>k</em>)) would grow faster than Θ(<em>n</em> lg <em>n</em>). <em>Give the _f</em> for <em>k</em> = Θ(<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)) and argue for why it is correct._</li>
  <li>Show that this value for <em>k</em> works by substituting it into Θ(<em>n__k</em> + <em>n</em> lg (<em>n</em>/<em>k</em>)) and showing that the resulting expression simplifies to Θ(<em>n</em> lg <em>n</em>). </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(d - 1pt)</strong> Now suppose we have implementations of InsertionSort and MergeSort. How should we choose the optimal value of <em>k</em> to use for these given implementations in practice? </p>

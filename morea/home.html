<h2 id="welcome-to-ics-311-spring-2014">Welcome to ICS 311, Spring 2014</h2>

<p><strong>If you are an ICS 311, Spring 2014 student, do not use this site.</strong>  Instead, refer to the <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/index.html">real site</a>.</p>

<p>This is a representation of a subset of the course material for ICS 311 Algorithms, Spring 2014, created to illustrate the use of the 
Morea Framework.</p>

<p>As of April, 2014, the site contains the Modules, Readings, and Experiences from ICS 311.  It does not include actual Outcome or Assessment entities. We plan to update the site with Outcomes and Assessments in the near future.</p>

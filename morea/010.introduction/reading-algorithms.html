  <h2>Algorithms and Programs</h2>

<p>By now you have a working idea of what a &quot;program&quot; is because you have written
many. Programs are particular instructions that work on specific machines.</p>

<p>In this course we work with an abstraction of programs: algorithms.</p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>Informally, an algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value(s) as input and produces some value(s) as output.</p>

<p>Somewhat more formally, an algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions
chosen from a finite, fixed set of instructions, where the sequence of
instructions satisfies the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> It has zero or more input parameters. </li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> It produces at least one output parameter. </li>
<li><strong>Definiteness:</strong> Each instruction must be clear and unambiguous. </li>
<li><strong>Finiteness:</strong> For every input, it executes only a finite number of instructions (it eventually halts). </li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Every instruction must be sufficiently basic so that a machine can execute the instruction.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Discussion:</em> What is the difference between an algorithm and a program?</p>

<p><em>Discussion:</em> What kinds of algorithms do you think are needed when you use
your smartphone (or any mobile phone for that matter?)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Algorithm Design &amp; Analysis</h2>

<p>Here is how algorithm design is situated within the phases of problem solving
in software development:</p>

<p>Phase 1: <strong>Formulation of the Problem</strong> (Requirements Specification)</p>

<p>To understand a real problem, <strong>model it mathematically</strong>, and specify
input and output of the problem clearly.</p>

<p>Phase 2: <strong>Design and Analysis of an Algorithm</strong> for the Problem (our focus)</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: <strong>Specification</strong> of an Algorithm - <strong>what is it?</strong></li>
<li>Step 2: <strong>Verification</strong> of the Algorithm - <strong>is it correct?</strong></li>
<li>Step 3: <strong>Analysis</strong> of the Algorithms - <strong>what is its time and space complexity?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 3: <strong>Implementation of the Algorithm</strong></p>

<p>Design data structures and realize the algorithm as executable code for
a targeted platform (lower level abstraction).</p>

<p>Phase 4: <strong>Performance Evaluation of the Implementation</strong> (Testing)</p>

<p>The predicted performance of the algorithm can be evaluated/verified by
empirical testing.</p>

<p>Algorithms are often specified in <strong>pseudocode</strong>, a mixture of programming
language control structures, mathematical notation, and natural language
written to be as unambiguous as possible. Examples will be given in the next
lecture. In this course, we will use mostly the notation used in the book.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Why not just test programs?</h3>

<p>Why not just run experimental studies on programs? We can implement the
algorithms of interest, run them on a modern computer on various input sizes,
and compare the results. Why bother with all this math in the book?</p>

<p>I find the math painful too, but there are three major limitations to
experimental studies:</p>

<ul>
<li>To run experiments, you have to implement and run the algorithm. Implementation takes time, and some of these runs may take a long time.</li>
<li>Experiments can only be done on a limited set of test inputs. Are you sure your results generalize to all possible inputs? </li>
<li>It is difficult to compare the efficency of tests run on one hardware and software environment to what will happen on others. Are you sure that your results generalize across platforms? </li>
</ul>

<p>Formal analysis of algorithms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can be performed on a high-level description of the algorithm without implementation.</li>
<li>Takes into account all possible inputs. </li>
<li>Allows comparisons of algorithms independently of hardware and software.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, there is a good reason ICS 311 is THE central course of the ICS
curriculum! Stick with us.</p>

<h2>Computational Complexity</h2>

<h3>Input Size</h3>

<p>The computational complexity of an algorithm generally depends on the amount
of information given as input to the algorithm.</p>

<p>This amount can be formally defined as the <strong>number of bits</strong> needed to
represent the input information with a reasonable, non-redundant coding
scheme.</p>

<p>To simplify things, we often analyze algorithms in terms of larger constant-
sized <strong>data units</strong> (e.g., signed integer, floating point number, string of
bounded length, or data record).</p>

<p>These units are a <em>constant factor</em> larger than a single bit, and are operated
on as a unit, so the result of the analysis is the same.</p>

<h3>Measures of Complexity</h3>

<p>The choice of algorithms and data structures has a critical impact on the
following, both of which are used as measures of computational complexity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run <strong>time</strong> to solve a problem of a given input size</li>
<li>Storage <strong>space</strong> for data, including auxiliary structures</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example (preview of next lecture)</h3>

<p>For example, suppose you have an input size of n elements, such as n strings
to be sorted in lexicographic order. Suppose further that you have two
algorithms at your disposal (these algorithms will be examined in detail in
the next lecture):</p>

<p><strong>Insertion sort</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>start with an empty list </li>
<li>take each item to be sorted and insert it in its proper location </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Merge sort</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>if the list has only one item, return it </li>
<li>otherwise, split the list in half, sort each half with this procedure, and then merge the results </li>
</ol>

<p>We will see that given <em>n</em> items to be sorted (it does not matter what they
are as long as they are bounded by a constant size and can be compared by an &lt;
operator),</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Insertion sort</em> takes time proportional to <em>c</em>1<em>n</em>2 steps, where <em>c</em>1 is a constant depending on the implementation, and requires space proportional to <em>n</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Merge sort</em> takes <em>c</em>2<em>n</em> lg(<em>n</em>) steps, where <em>c</em>2 is another constant depending on the merge sort implementation, and requires space proportional to 2<em>n</em>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Exercise:</em> This would be a good place for you to pause and do excercise
1.2-2, page 14:</p>

<p>Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on
the same machine, where c1=8 and c2=16. For which values of n does insertion
sort beat merge sort?</p>

<p>Constants matter for small input sizes, but since constants don&#39;t grow we
ignore them when concerned with the time complexity of large inputs: it is the
growth in terms of <em>n</em> that matters.</p>

<p>In the example above, ignoring the constants and factoring out the common n in
each term shows that the difference in growth rate is <em>n</em> versus lg(<em>n</em>). For
one million items to sort, this would be a time factor of one million for
insertion sort, but about 20 for merge sort.</p>

<h3>Models of Computation</h3>

<p>Rather than bother with determining the constant factors for any given
implementation or computer, algorithms for a problem are analyzed by using an
abstract machine called a <strong>model of computation</strong>.</p>

<p>Many models of computation have been proposed, but they are essentially
equivalent to each other (Church-Turing Thesis) as long as computation
executed on them are <em>deterministic</em> and <em>sequential</em>. Commonly used models
are <em>Turing Machines</em> and <em>Random Access Machines</em> (see Section 2.2 of the
textbook).</p>

<h3>Run Times for Different Complexities</h3>

<p>In general, suppose that you have a computer of speed 107 steps per second.
The running time of algorithms of the given complexity (rows) as a function of
<em>n</em> would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">  --------------------------------------------------------------------

<p><em>Discussion:</em> What is the difference between analysis of an algorithm and
analysis of an implementation (a program)?</p>

<p><em>Discussion:</em> What is the relationship between the efficiency of an algorithm
and the difficulty of the problem to be solved by that algorithm? (We return
to this in the last two topics of the semester, but see also below.)</p>

<p>Consider the example above: the problem of sorting a list of items. We saw two
algorithms for solving the problem, one more efficient than the other. Is it
possible to make a statement about the time efficiency of <em>any possible</em>
algorithm for the problem of sorting? (We address this question in Topic #10.)</p>

<h3>Easy vs Hard Problems</h3>

<p>Theoretical computer science has made substantial progress on understanding
the intrinsic difficulty of <em>problems</em> (across all possible algorithms),
although there are still significant open questions (one in particular).</p>

<p>First of all, there are problems that we cannot solve, i.e., problems for
which there does not exist any algorithm. Those problems are called
<strong>unsolvable</strong> (or <strong>undecidable</strong> or <strong>incomputable</strong>), and include the
<em>Halting Problem</em> (refer to Section 3.1 pp. 176-177 of the textbook for ICS141
&amp; 241).</p>

<p>Within the problems that can be solved, there is a hierarchy of <strong>complexity
classes</strong> according to how difficult they are. Difficulty is based on proofs
of the minimum complexity of <em>any</em> algorithm that solves the problem, and on
proofs of equivalences between problems (translating one into another). Here
is a graphic:</p>

<p><img src="Complexity-Hierarchy.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>(Although algorithms can be ranked by this hierarchy, the above figure refers
to problem classes, not algorithms.)</p>

<p>Sometimes small differences in a problem specification can make a big
difference in complexity.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you use a graph of vertices representing cities and
weighted edges between the vertices representing the distance via the best
road traveling directly between the cities.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Single Pair Shortest Paths</strong> problem: what is the shortest path between a single pair of vertices (from one start vertex to one destination vertex) in the weighted graph? </li>
<li>The <strong>Shortest Paths</strong> problem: what is the shortest path from one vertex to all of the other vertices in the weighted graph? </li>
<li>The <strong>All Pairs Shortest Paths</strong> problem: what is the shortest path between every pair of vertices in the weighted graph? </li>
<li>The <strong>Traveling Salesman</strong> problem: what is the shortest path that starts at given vertex in a weighted graph and visits all (or a specified set of) other vertices once before returning to the start vertex?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Discussion:</em> How do these problems differ from each other? Which are easier
and which are harder? Which are tractable (e.g., can be computed in polynomial
time) and which are potentially intractable (e.g, require exponential time)?</p>

<p>Complexity theory will be the topic of our second to last lecture.</p>

<h2>Abstract Data Types</h2>

<p>Algorithms and data structures go together. We often study algorithms in the
context of Abstract Data Types (ADTs). But let&#39;s start with Data Structures.</p>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>

<p>You are already familiar with Data Structures. They are defined by:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Specifications of external appearance of a data structure. </li>
<li><strong>Storage Structures:</strong> Organizations of data implemented in lower level data structures. (We are almost always building abstractions on layers of abstractions above the actual physical implementation.) </li>
<li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Description of how to manipulate information in the storage structures to obtain the results defined for the operations </li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of a data structure requires that you specify implementation
details such as storage structures and algorithms. It would be better to hide
these details until we are ready to deal with them.</p>

<p>Also we may want to write a specification in terms of desired behavior
(Operations) and then compare alternative storage structures and algorithms as
possible solutions meeting those specifications. Data structures don&#39;t work
because they already assume a given solution. Abstract Data Types or ADTs let
us do this by abstracting the representations and algorithms.</p>

<h3>Definition of Abstract Data Types (ADTs)</h3>

<p>An ADT is a class of instances (i.e., data objects) with a set of the
operations that can be applied to the data objects.</p>

<p>An ADT tells us <em>what to do</em> instead of how to do it. This provides the
specifications againsts which we can design different algorithms: the <em>how</em>
part.</p>

<p>An ADT is specified by</p>

<ol>
<li>*<em>the type(s) of data objects involved *</em></li>
<li><strong>a set of operations that can be applied to those objects</strong>, and </li>
<li><strong>a set of properties (called axioms) that all the objects and operations must satisfy</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example: Stack ADT</h3>

<p>Objects:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">Stack, and Elements (of arbitrary type) 
</code></pre></div>
<p>Operations (categorized into three types):</p>

<p>Constructor</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">`new()` creates the empty stack and returns it.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Accessors</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> `empty(_s_)` returns whether stack _s_ is empty.  
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>top(_s_)</code> returns the element of stack <em>s</em> that has been inserted into s
last.</p>

<p>Mutators (or Modifiers)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> `push(_s_,_e_)` inserts an element _e_ into _s_.  
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>pop(_s_)</code> deletes the top element from stack <em>s</em>.</p>

<p>Properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>top(push(_s_,_e_)) returns value _e_</code></li>
<li><code>pop(push(_s_,_e_)) leaves _s_</code> in the same state </li>
<li><code>empty(new()) = true</code></li>
<li><code>empty(push(_s_,_i_)) = false</code></li>
<li><code>pop(new()) is an error</code></li>
<li><code>top(new()) is an error</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Specification and Implementation</h3>

<p>ADTs can be specified in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>formal languages (axiomatic, algebraic, functional, denotational semantics, etc.)</li>
<li>natural language</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementation of an ADT requires</p>

<ul>
<li>defining the storage for the data structures</li>
<li>implementing the algorithms for the operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages of ADTs</h3>

<p>Modularity (Encapsulation)</p>

<p>Abstract operations mean a program using an ADT are isolated from (need not know about or be affected by) the implementation of the ADT.</p>

<ul>
<li>Implementation of ADT can be changed without modifying programs using ADT.</li>
<li>Makes a program smaller, simpler, and have less side effects<br></li>
<li>Helps to construct correct programs </li>
</ul>

<p>Hierarchical Specification</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> Supports Top-Down Design and Stepwise Refinement
</code></pre></div>
<p>Implementation</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">ADTs map well to Object-Oriented Programming Languages
</code></pre></div>

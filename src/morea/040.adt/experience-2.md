## Basic Data Structures

####  5 points

**1\. (4 pts)** For each of the four types of lists in the following table, what is the _asymptotic worst-case running time_ for each dynamic set operation listed, given a list of length _n_? 

  * Assume that __k_ is the key_, _d_ the data associated with the key, and __p_ a position_ in the data structure.
  * As explained in class, positions abstract and provide encapsulated access to elements of a data structure. We don't have to search for the item if we have a position p for it.
  * Sorted lists are sorted in _ascending order_.
  * Predecessor, successor, minimum, and maximum are _with respect to ordering of keys in the set under "<"_, not necessarily ordering of the list data structure.
  * The cells filled in are from the quiz.

**2\. (1 pt)** Write a Î˜(_n_)-time recursive procedure that, _given an _n_-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node of the tree_ in any order you wish. Assume that trees consist of vertices of class `TreeNode` with instance variables `parent`, `left`, `right`, and `key`. Your recursive procedure takes a `TreeNode` as its argument (the root of the tree or subtree being considered by the recursive call).

    printTreeNodes(TreeNode root)
        if (root != null) {

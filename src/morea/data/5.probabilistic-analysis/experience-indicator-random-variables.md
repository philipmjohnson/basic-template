# Indicator Random Variable Analysis

Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of _n_
rolls of a fair dice that has _s_ sides. A fair dice can have values from 1 to
_s_ with equal probability. Do it in these steps, and answer the numbered
questions:

Define the _indicator_ random variable _X__i_ = I {the event of a dice coming
up with value _i_}, for each _i_ = {1, 2, ... _s_}.

**1.** What is Pr{_X__i_ = 1} for each i? 

**2.** What is E[_X__i_]? In other words, the expected value of _X__i_? 

Define the _regular_ random variable _X_ to be the value of a single roll of a
dice with _s_ sides.

**3.** Write an equation expressing _X_ in terms of _X__i_.   _(Keep in mind that indicator random variables take on values 0 or 1.)_

**4.** Take the expectation of both sides of this equation and solve for E[_X_], the expected value of _X_.   _(Show all steps, like was done in the derivation of the expected number of inversions.)_

**5.** Use the result to write an expression for the expected value of _n_ rolls of an _s_-sided fair dice. 

# Additional Activity

If you finish the above early, this will get you started on future work.

Suppose I assigned the _n_ students in a class randomly to groups, with no
constraint on group size, but I decided in advance to have _n_/4 groups.

**6.** Let's pick two students from our class. Call them Michael Jackson and Bruno Mars. What is the probability that Michael and Bruno end up in the same group? Express as a function of _n_.

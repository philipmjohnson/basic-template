## Welcome to ICS 311, Spring 2014

This is preliminary version of a Morea course website for ICS 311 Algorithms, taught Spring 2014 by Dan Suthers.

**If you are an ICS 311 student, do not use this site.**  Instead, refer to the [real site](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/index.html).

Generally the course is run within [Laulima](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal/site/MAN.82792.201430). Notes and other material are posted on this site,
[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/),
and on YouTube. However, course participants
will need to log into Laulima regularly to watch screencasts, take quizzes, submit assignments, and
to use other facilities such as discussions and the mail tool as needed. Classes are in
[Webster 101](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/map.jpg).

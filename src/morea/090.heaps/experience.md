### 1\. Heap-Delete(A, i)

#### 2 points

Procedure `Heap-Delete(_A_, _i_)` deletes the node at index _i_ in heap _A_
(represented as an array). Give an implementation of `Heap-Delete` that runs
in O(lg _n_) time for a heap of size _n_ = `A.heapSize`. You may use instance
variable `A.heapSize` and any of the other procedures already defined in the
text.

_This is very similar to an existing procedure._

### 2\. Heapsort on Sorted Data

#### 3 points

**(a)** What is the asymptotic running time of `Heapsort` on an array _A_ of _n_ elements that is _already sorted in **_increasing_** order_?

**(b)** What is the asymptotic running time of `Heapsort` on an array _A_ of _n_ elements that is _already sorted in **_decreasing_** order_?

**(c)** For which of these cases would `Heapsort` make _more swaps of elements in the array_, or are they the same?

_Give your reasoning to help grading feedback. You might start working an
example for each case, but don't get bogged down in details: return to high
level asymptotic reasoning as soon as you see what is going on. _Refer to line
numbers in code _ when discussing your analyses. _

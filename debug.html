  "## Algorithms and Programs\n\nBy now you have a working idea of what a \"program\" is because you have written\nmany. Programs are particular instructions that work on specific machines.\n\nIn this course we work with an abstraction of programs: algorithms.\n\n### Algorithms\n\nInformally, an algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes\nsome value(s) as input and produces some value(s) as output.\n\nSomewhat more formally, an algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions\nchosen from a finite, fixed set of instructions, where the sequence of\ninstructions satisfies the following criteria:\n\n  * **Input:** It has zero or more input parameters. \n  * **Output:** It produces at least one output parameter. \n  * **Definiteness:** Each instruction must be clear and unambiguous. \n  * **Finiteness:** For every input, it executes only a finite number of instructions (it eventually halts). \n  * **Effectiveness:** Every instruction must be sufficiently basic so that a machine can execute the instruction.\n\n_Discussion:_ What is the difference between an algorithm and a program?\n\n_Discussion:_ What kinds of algorithms do you think are needed when you use\nyour smartphone (or any mobile phone for that matter?)\n\n* * *\n\n## Algorithm Design & Analysis\n\nHere is how algorithm design is situated within the phases of problem solving\nin software development:\n\nPhase 1: **Formulation of the Problem** (Requirements Specification)\n\nTo understand a real problem, **model it mathematically**, and specify\ninput and output of the problem clearly.\n\n  \nPhase 2: **Design and Analysis of an Algorithm** for the Problem (our focus)\n\n* Step 1: **Specification** of an Algorithm - **what is it?**\n* Step 2: **Verification** of the Algorithm - **is it correct?**\n* Step 3: **Analysis** of the Algorithms - **what is its time and space complexity?**\n\nPhase 3: **Implementation of the Algorithm**\n\nDesign data structures and realize the algorithm as executable code for\na targeted platform (lower level abstraction).\n\nPhase 4: **Performance Evaluation of the Implementation** (Testing)\n\nThe predicted performance of the algorithm can be evaluated/verified by\nempirical testing.\n\nAlgorithms are often specified in **pseudocode**, a mixture of programming\nlanguage control structures, mathematical notation, and natural language\nwritten to be as unambiguous as possible. Examples will be given in the next\nlecture. In this course, we will use mostly the notation used in the book.\n\n* * *\n\n###  Why not just test programs?\n\nWhy not just run experimental studies on programs? We can implement the\nalgorithms of interest, run them on a modern computer on various input sizes,\nand compare the results. Why bother with all this math in the book?\n\nI find the math painful too, but there are three major limitations to\nexperimental studies:\n\n  * To run experiments, you have to implement and run the algorithm. Implementation takes time, and some of these runs may take a long time.\n  * Experiments can only be done on a limited set of test inputs. Are you sure your results generalize to all possible inputs? \n  * It is difficult to compare the efficency of tests run on one hardware and software environment to what will happen on others. Are you sure that your results generalize across platforms? \n\nFormal analysis of algorithms:\n\n  * Can be performed on a high-level description of the algorithm without implementation.\n  * Takes into account all possible inputs. \n  * Allows comparisons of algorithms independently of hardware and software.\n\nSo, there is a good reason ICS 311 is THE central course of the ICS\ncurriculum! Stick with us.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## Computational Complexity\n\n### Input Size\n\nThe computational complexity of an algorithm generally depends on the amount\nof information given as input to the algorithm.\n\nThis amount can be formally defined as the **number of bits** needed to\nrepresent the input information with a reasonable, non-redundant coding\nscheme.\n\nTo simplify things, we often analyze algorithms in terms of larger constant-\nsized **data units** (e.g., signed integer, floating point number, string of\nbounded length, or data record).\n\nThese units are a _constant factor_ larger than a single bit, and are operated\non as a unit, so the result of the analysis is the same.\n\n### Measures of Complexity\n\nThe choice of algorithms and data structures has a critical impact on the\nfollowing, both of which are used as measures of computational complexity:\n\n  * Run **time** to solve a problem of a given input size\n  * Storage **space** for data, including auxiliary structures\n\n###  Example (preview of next lecture)\n\nFor example, suppose you have an input size of n elements, such as n strings\nto be sorted in lexicographic order. Suppose further that you have two\nalgorithms at your disposal (these algorithms will be examined in detail in\nthe next lecture):\n\n**Insertion sort**:\n    \n\n  1. start with an empty list \n  2. take each item to be sorted and insert it in its proper location \n  \n**Merge sort**:\n    \n\n  1. if the list has only one item, return it \n  2. otherwise, split the list in half, sort each half with this procedure, and then merge the results \n\nWe will see that given _n_ items to be sorted (it does not matter what they\nare as long as they are bounded by a constant size and can be compared by an <\noperator),\n\n  * _Insertion sort_ takes time proportional to _c_1_n_2 steps, where _c_1 is a constant depending on the implementation, and requires space proportional to _n_.\n  \n\n  * _Merge sort_ takes _c_2_n_ lg(_n_) steps, where _c_2 is another constant depending on the merge sort implementation, and requires space proportional to 2_n_. \n\n_Exercise:_ This would be a good place for you to pause and do excercise\n1.2-2, page 14:\n\nSuppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on\nthe same machine, where c1=8 and c2=16. For which values of n does insertion\nsort beat merge sort?\n\nConstants matter for small input sizes, but since constants don't grow we\nignore them when concerned with the time complexity of large inputs: it is the\ngrowth in terms of _n_ that matters.\n\nIn the example above, ignoring the constants and factoring out the common n in\neach term shows that the difference in growth rate is _n_ versus lg(_n_). For\none million items to sort, this would be a time factor of one million for\ninsertion sort, but about 20 for merge sort.\n\n### Models of Computation\n\nRather than bother with determining the constant factors for any given\nimplementation or computer, algorithms for a problem are analyzed by using an\nabstract machine called a **model of computation**.\n\nMany models of computation have been proposed, but they are essentially\nequivalent to each other (Church-Turing Thesis) as long as computation\nexecuted on them are _deterministic_ and _sequential_. Commonly used models\nare _Turing Machines_ and _Random Access Machines_ (see Section 2.2 of the\ntextbook).\n\n### Run Times for Different Complexities\n\nIn general, suppose that you have a computer of speed 107 steps per second.\nThe running time of algorithms of the given complexity (rows) as a function of\n_n_ would be:\n\n    \n    \n      --------------------------------------------------------------------\n      size n    10       20       30       50      100       1000    10000\n      --------------------------------------------------------------------\n      n         0.001ms  0.002ms  0.003ms  0.005ms  0.01ms   0.1ms     1ms\n      n lg n    0.003ms  0.008ms  0.015ms  0.03ms   0.07ms   1ms      13ms\n      n^2       0.01ms   0.04ms   0.09ms   0.25ms   1ms      100ms    10s\n      n^3       0.1ms    0.8ms    2.7ms    12.5ms   100ms    100s     28h\n    \n      ...................................................................\n    \n      2^n       0.1ms    0.1s     100s     3yr      3x10^13c  inf     inf\n      --------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n\n_Discussion:_ What is the difference between analysis of an algorithm and\nanalysis of an implementation (a program)?\n\n_Discussion:_ What is the relationship between the efficiency of an algorithm\nand the difficulty of the problem to be solved by that algorithm? (We return\nto this in the last two topics of the semester, but see also below.)\n\nConsider the example above: the problem of sorting a list of items. We saw two\nalgorithms for solving the problem, one more efficient than the other. Is it\npossible to make a statement about the time efficiency of _any possible_\nalgorithm for the problem of sorting? (We address this question in Topic #10.)\n\n### Easy vs Hard Problems\n\nTheoretical computer science has made substantial progress on understanding\nthe intrinsic difficulty of _problems_ (across all possible algorithms),\nalthough there are still significant open questions (one in particular).\n\nFirst of all, there are problems that we cannot solve, i.e., problems for\nwhich there does not exist any algorithm. Those problems are called\n**unsolvable** (or **undecidable** or **incomputable**), and include the\n_Halting Problem_ (refer to Section 3.1 pp. 176-177 of the textbook for ICS141\n& 241).\n\nWithin the problems that can be solved, there is a hierarchy of **complexity\nclasses** according to how difficult they are. Difficulty is based on proofs\nof the minimum complexity of _any_ algorithm that solves the problem, and on\nproofs of equivalences between problems (translating one into another). Here\nis a graphic:\n\n![](/morea/data/1.introduction/Complexity-Hierarchy.jpg)\n\n(Although algorithms can be ranked by this hierarchy, the above figure refers\nto problem classes, not algorithms.)\n\nSometimes small differences in a problem specification can make a big\ndifference in complexity.\n\nFor example, suppose you use a graph of vertices representing cities and\nweighted edges between the vertices representing the distance via the best\nroad traveling directly between the cities.\n\n  * The **Single Pair Shortest Paths** problem: what is the shortest path between a single pair of vertices (from one start vertex to one destination vertex) in the weighted graph? \n  * The **Shortest Paths** problem: what is the shortest path from one vertex to all of the other vertices in the weighted graph? \n  * The **All Pairs Shortest Paths** problem: what is the shortest path between every pair of vertices in the weighted graph? \n  * The **Traveling Salesman** problem: what is the shortest path that starts at given vertex in a weighted graph and visits all (or a specified set of) other vertices once before returning to the start vertex?\n\n_Discussion:_ How do these problems differ from each other? Which are easier\nand which are harder? Which are tractable (e.g., can be computed in polynomial\ntime) and which are potentially intractable (e.g, require exponential time)?\n\nComplexity theory will be the topic of our second to last lecture.\n\n* * *\n\n##  Abstract Data Types\n\nAlgorithms and data structures go together. We often study algorithms in the\ncontext of Abstract Data Types (ADTs). But let's start with Data Structures.\n\n### Data Structures\n\nYou are already familiar with Data Structures. They are defined by:\n\n  * **Operations:** Specifications of external appearance of a data structure. \n  * **Storage Structures:** Organizations of data implemented in lower level data structures. (We are almost always building abstractions on layers of abstractions above the actual physical implementation.) \n  * **Algorithms:** Description of how to manipulate information in the storage structures to obtain the results defined for the operations \n\nThe definition of a data structure requires that you specify implementation\ndetails such as storage structures and algorithms. It would be better to hide\nthese details until we are ready to deal with them.\n\nAlso we may want to write a specification in terms of desired behavior\n(Operations) and then compare alternative storage structures and algorithms as\npossible solutions meeting those specifications. Data structures don't work\nbecause they already assume a given solution. Abstract Data Types or ADTs let\nus do this by abstracting the representations and algorithms.\n\n### Definition of Abstract Data Types (ADTs)\n\nAn ADT is a class of instances (i.e., data objects) with a set of the\noperations that can be applied to the data objects.\n\nAn ADT tells us _what to do_ instead of how to do it. This provides the\nspecifications againsts which we can design different algorithms: the _how_\npart.\n\nAn ADT is specified by\n\n  1. **the type(s) of data objects involved **\n  2. **a set of operations that can be applied to those objects**, and \n  3. **a set of properties (called axioms) that all the objects and operations must satisfy**.\n\n### Example: Stack ADT\n\nObjects:\n\n    Stack, and Elements (of arbitrary type) \n  \nOperations (categorized into three types):\n\n\nConstructor\n\n    `new()` creates the empty stack and returns it.\n\nAccessors\n\n     `empty(_s_)` returns whether stack _s_ is empty.  \n`top(_s_)` returns the element of stack _s_ that has been inserted into s\nlast.\n\nMutators (or Modifiers)\n\n     `push(_s_,_e_)` inserts an element _e_ into _s_.  \n`pop(_s_)` deletes the top element from stack _s_.\n\n  \nProperties:\n\n  * `top(push(_s_,_e_)) returns value _e_`\n  * `pop(push(_s_,_e_)) leaves _s_` in the same state \n  * `empty(new()) = true `\n  * `empty(push(_s_,_i_)) = false `\n  * `pop(new()) is an error `\n  * `top(new()) is an error `\n\n### Specification and Implementation\n\nADTs can be specified in different languages:\n\n  * formal languages (axiomatic, algebraic, functional, denotational semantics, etc.)\n  * natural language\n\nImplementation of an ADT requires\n\n  * defining the storage for the data structures\n  * implementing the algorithms for the operations\n\n### Advantages of ADTs\n\nModularity (Encapsulation)\n\nAbstract operations mean a program using an ADT are isolated from (need not know about or be affected by) the implementation of the ADT.\n\n  * Implementation of ADT can be changed without modifying programs using ADT.\n  * Makes a program smaller, simpler, and have less side effects   \n  * Helps to construct correct programs \n  \nHierarchical Specification\n\n     Supports Top-Down Design and Stepwise Refinement\n  \nImplementation\n\n    ADTs map well to Object-Oriented Programming Languages\n\n_Discussion:_ What is the difference between an ADT and a data structure?\n\n* * *\n\n_Some of the material in this page was adopted with permission (and\nsignificant editing) from Kazuo Sugihara's spring 2011 Lecture Notes #02._\n\n",

  "## Overview\n\nThe approach to assignments, exams, and relative weighting is intended to\nassess multiple aspects of your developing expertise in algorithm design,\nanalysis and implementation; while providing a little flexibility to recognize\nindividual strengths. In summary, the components and their default weights\n(percentages and points, where 10 points = 1% of your grade) include:\n\n  * **Quizzes** (120 points = 12%, 24 quizzes of 5 points each),\n  * **Problem Sets** (305 points = 30.5%, 8 sets of 30 points, 3 sets of 15 points, 1 set of 20 points; of which 105 is _in-class_ work and 200 _homework_)\n  * **Projects** (260 points = 26%, three at 60, 100, and 100 points, respectively)\n  * **Midterm Exams** (240 points = 24%, three at 80 points each)\n  * **Final Exam** (100 points = 10% of grade). \n\nThis sums to 1025 points: you can miss 25 points of work and still earn 1000\npoints.\n\nExtra credit (Variable), may be earned by peer assessment of group\nparticipation in class, by additional work that will be specified in some\nhomework problems and implementation assignments, and by having others use\nyour software in the third assigment. (There will be no separate extra credit\nproblems or projects, as this creates more grading work than we have TA time.)\n\n## Points, Percents and Letter Grades\n\nA \"point\" will be worth 0.1% of your grade. For example, an item worth 100\npoints is 10% of your grade, and a perfect score is 1000 points. At the end of\nthe semester, I add up all your points and divide by 10 to get your percentage\nof points earned, capping it at 100%.\n\nTo determine letter grades, I use a 4-percent spread per grade increment,\ni.e., 100-97=A+, 96-93=A, 92-89=A-, 88-85=B+, 84-81=B, 80-77=B-, 76-73=C+,\n72-69=C, 68-65=C-, 64-61=D+, 60-57=D, 56-53=D-, 52-0=F. I will set it up this\nway in Laulima. If upon inspection of the distribution of grades I feel that\ntoo many students who understand the material are not getting the grades they\ndeserve, I may then make adjustments in favor of students ... but don't rely\non this!\n\n## Components\n\n**Quizzes (12%, 120 points):**\n\nBefore the classes that have lecture material, a brief quiz will be due online. These quizzes will test basic understanding of the chapter on which the day's topic is based, such as whether you can simulate the operation of the data structure or algorithms or get the main point of the analyses of their relative merits. Most quizzes will not involve mathematical analysis or proofs: problems requiring deeper thought will be left for the classwork and homework problems. Quizzes will be given in Laulima, and will be automatically graded. Solutions will be given in class immediately after the quizzes are due, so _quizzes cannot be made up_.\n  \nI am expecting 24 quizzes worth 5 points each. There are 25 topics. We don't\ninclude Topic 1 or the two special topics, which leaves 22 topics with\nquizzes, but Topic 2 and Topic 14 have two quizzes.\n\n  \n**Problems (30.5%, 305 points):**\n\nThese will relatively frequent assignments intended to help assess how well you understand the algorithms and analytic concepts being presented. They will require more thought than the problems given on the quizzes. They will come in two parts: an in-class portion done, turned in, and graded in groups, and an after-class portion turned in individually the following Monday. I attempt to choose in-class problems that help expose conceptual issues in the material and prepare you to work on the take-home portion on your own. Thus, by working in a group in class you help each other understand the problem that you will then solve and turn in individually. See also \"Peer Evaluation of Participation\" under Extra Credit below for how everyone can earn extra credit through participating in the group sessions.\n  \nPoints are allocated as follows. Most topics are allocated 15 points, of which\n5 are allocated to the group work turned in at the end of class, and 10 to the\nindividual work turned in later. In 8 of the weeks, the problem set will\nconsist of two topics, for 30 points each week (10 being groupwork turned in\nover the two days and 20 turned in by the individual). In 3 of the weeks,\nthere is one topic, for 15 points. When we cover Topic 14 on Graphs, there\nwill be two in-class problems and one homework for 20 points. The TA will\ngrade problem sets. We aspire to a one week or less turn-around. If you have\nquestions about solutions after they are due or graded, post them in Laulima\nand I will discuss solutions in class after the exercises are due.\n\n  \n**Projects (Analysis, Implementation, Testing) (26%, 260 points):**\n\nThere will be three projects. These typically involve writing Java implementations of abstract data types and associated algorithms, and testing these on sample data. You will also provide instructions on how to compile and run the program, document your design and implementation (including complexith analysis), and present and discuss test results. The assignments will progressively give you more responsibility. For the first project, you will be told what to implement, and it will be weighted 6% (60 points). For the second assignment you will need to make some implementation choices. The second assignment will be weighted 10% (100 points). The third assignment will require some research and decision making on your part to solve the problem. It will be weighted 10% (100 points). The TA will grade the first two projects, and both the TA and the instructor will grade the third.\n  \n**Midterms (24%, 240 points):**\n\nThere will be three midterm exams taking one class period each. They will include problems similar to those on the quizzes (for the easiest problems), and class and homework problems (for the harder ones), covering both understanding of the algorithms and how to analyze them. They will cover the most recent set of lecture topics, but cumulative \"review\" questions may also be included. Exams are open-book, open-notes on paper, but no electronic devices allowed. Each midterm is 80 points; there are three for 240 points or 24%. The instructor will grade all midterm exams.\n  \n**Final (10%, 100 points):**\n\nThe final exam will take place at the time scheduled by the university and will be longer than a midterm exam. It will cover the final set of lecture topics, but also include review of the entire semester. Since the final is longer and is cumulative as well as covering recent material, it is weighted more (100 points). Grading may be shared between TA and instructor.\n\n## Extra Credit (Variable Points)\n\nYou may earn extra credit several ways. _The extra credit points will be\nrecorded in a separate field in Laulima and allocated where they are needed at\nthe end of the semester. Thus they do not appear in the grade estimate\ncalculated by Laulima during the semester._\n\n**Peer Evaluation of Participation**\n\nEach week in which there is a problem set, each individual in the group may assign points distributed across the other individuals in the group to assess how effectively they collaborated in the group. You should allocate the points according to how well the others worked as team members, including their role in team functioning (e.g., keeping the group focused and organized, or playing another important role), and how much they helped others understand the material (e.g., by explaining what they understood), as well as their contributions to the actual problem solution.\n  \nTo ensure that students in smaller groups are not penalized, we use this\nscheme, which distributes 12 points across each group:  \n\n  * If _three members_ besides yourself were present at some time, you have a total of _3 points_ to allocate across all members (NOT 3 points per member!).\n  * If only _two members_ besides yourself were present, you have a total of _4 points_ to allocate across all members.\n  * If only _one other member_ was present, you have a total of _6 points_ to allocate to that person. \n  * You need not allocate all the points available to you.\n  * _You cannot allocate these points to yourself!_ Points allocated to yourself will not be recorded.\n  * You will allocate these points when you turn in your assignment. To encourage you to do this, _you will be given one extra credit point for each assignment in which you assess your peers_.\n  \nSome example scenarios: if everyone else contributed equally, you might give 1\npoint to each person. If one person in the group was taking the majority of\nthe initiative in a helpful way and the other two were not so engaged, you\nmight assign the helpful person all three points If there was one person who\ndid slightly more, one who helped some, and one slacker, you might allocate 2,\n1, and 0 points. Or if you had to do everything yourself you can allocate 0\npoints to everyone.  \n  \nObviously, a person who is helpful in the groups can earn extra credit this\nway. The maximum possible (very unlikely) is that they get all the points from\neveryone in every group they participate in: 9*12=108, or about a 10% grade\nincrease. If everyone gave their three points equally to all group members,\nthe result would be 3*12=36 points, or about a 3.5% grade increase. So, just\nby participating in class you get a little boost to your grade.\n\n  \n**Classwork, Homework and Project Add-ons**\n\nExtra credit problems will be included in some class sessions, homework problem sets, and projects. For example, an extra problem may be provided in class for those groups who finish early; a more difficult problem may be included in a homework set; or a student may program more challenging graph manipulations for extra credit in the programming projects. Points will be specified when they are given.\n\n**Software Reuse**\n\nIn the third assignment, students will have the option of using other student's implementations of ADTs from prior assignments. If your software is chosen by another student, you will be awarded 5 points for each \"customer\" _in proportion to their grade and use of your software_. For example, if a student uses your Graph ADT from Project 2 in their Project 3 and gets 80%, you will get 4 points. Partial credit is given if only parts of your code are used. The \"customer\" student must acknowledge your code in their project documentation (Readme and Reference manual).\n\n## Flexibility\n\nWe each have our own strengths. If a student performs _significantly_ better\non one area than others, I may elect to put greater weight on the area that\ngives the student a better grade. I am more willing to do this with strong\nexam performance, as exams are not easy and are proctored so I know it's the\nstudent's work. However, excellent programming may be considered as well.\n\n",

  "Updated March 8, 2014 to discuss the use of GPL licenses.\n\nThis page discusses general procedures for implementation assignments and\nextra credit projects. See the individual assignment pages for details.\n\n## Implementation Assignments\n\n### Overview\n\nThere will be three implementation assignments. These will involve writing\nJava implementations of abstract data types and associated algorithms, and\ntesting the implementations on sample data. You will also provide instructions\non how to compile and run the program, document your design and implementation\n(including complexith analysis), and present and discuss test results. The\nassignments will progressively give you more responsibility. For the first\nproject, you will be told what to implement, and it will be weighted 6% (60\npoints). For the second assignment you will need to make some implementation\nchoices. The second assignment will be weighted 10% (100 points). The third\nassignment will require some research and decision making on your part to\nsolve the problem. It will be weighted 10% (100 points).\n\n### Software Requirements\n\nThe following requirements have been adopted from Dr. Sugihara:\n\n#### Programming Language\n\nAll software must be written in Java. Other programming languages may not be\nused except where specified by the assignment.\n\n**The software must be compilable on the default version of Java available on uhunix.hawaii.edu** at the time of the submission deadline. The reason for this is to ensure that there is a common reference environment against which we can resolve disputes. We can't grade projects on claims that \"it compiled on my machine\".\n\nUhunix is running [Solaris](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-\nstorage/solaris/overview/index.html). At this writing, the Java version is:\n\n    \n    \n    java version \"1.7.0_51\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)\n    \n\nProjects submitted with higher versions of Java (if they become available) are\nat your risk. Note that the instructor is presently running research projects\nin Java 1.6 in Snow Leopard on which Java 1.7 is not available. Some features\nof Java 1.7 do not compile in 1.6, so if you could stick to 1.6 features he\nwon't have to go to UH Unix to run your code.\n\n#### Program Type and Interface\n\nThe software should run as a Java application.\n\n  * Command line (console) applications are acceptable.\n  * GUI (graphical user interface versions) are also permissible.\n\n#### Source Code Requirements\n\nThe student shall **submit .java source files** (not class or jar files),\norganized in folders as required for your package structure, along with\ninstructions for compiling the program and other documentation discussed in\nthe next section.\n\n  * The Teaching Assistant will verify that the programs compile on the current version of Java on uhunix, as specified above.\n  * Submissions will only be evaluated for credit if they successfully compile.\n  * This procedure is intended to (1) enable us to verify that the software is based on the student's own source code and (2) provide an objective basis for evaluating whether code works..\n\nSource files should include the BSD License Header based on [ this\ntemplate,](../Resources/bsd_license_header.txt) with \"<year>\", \"<copyright\nholder>\" and \"<organization>\" replaced appropriately.\n\nOther open source licenses (e.g., [Apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/) or\n[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)) may be used with prior permission from\nthe instructor if the student has a specific reason for doing so and\nunderstands the consequences. See the discussion under Other Licenses two\nsections below.\n\nSource should include appropriate in-line comments documenting the software\ndesign. Comments should not document the obvious (e.g., \"this line adds 1 to\nthe index variable\"), but rather document functional intent and constraints\nsuch as loop invariants, explain something that would otherwise be obscure,\nmark places that need improvement, etc. Descriptive use of variable and method\nnames also constitutes internal documentation. See next section for external\ndocumentation requirements.\n\n#### Including Open Source Software\n\nEach assignment will specify where you are allowed to reuse source code of\nopen source software developed by other authors, and where you must write your\nown code for the assignment. Where allowed by the assignment, reuse of open\nsource code is allowed if the following conditions are also met:\n\n  * The software license of the reused open source code is compatible with the [ BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) (see discussion under Other Licenses below).\n  * The license header of reused source code is also inserted into the source files containing the reused source code.\n  * The `Readme.txt ` of your product clearly gives credit to the authors of the reused source code (i.e., including information such as the name of an author, the name of a reused product and a list of file names of the reused source code).\n\nWhen source code of a module is reused, add the name(s) of its original\nauthor(s) to an `@author` tag at the beginning of the reused module. If you\nmodified the source code for more than bug fixes, add your name as an author\nof a derivative from the original source code:\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @author     Original Author     James Brown\n     * @author     Derivative Author   Robert Smith\n     *\n     */\n\n#### Other Licenses\n\nI am often asked whether one can use code under another license. You may use\nother open source licenses as long as (1) they give you the right to use the\ncode under conditions acceptable to you and (2) you document this as needed.\nAn example is the GPL license. You may use a [GPL compatible\nlicense](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html), but you use this\nlicense, all the code you write _must_ also be under GPL. See\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_license> for an overview, and read\nsome blogs about this hotly debated issue.\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\nSoftware will be submitted with appropriate documentation, including the\nfollowing. (Think of your audience for this documentation as any potential\nusers, including your classmates as well as the TA and instructor.)\n\n**Readme.txt (plaintext file)**\n\nCritical information that a user should know about your product first, including:\n\n  * step-wise instructions for the user to reconstruct an application from your source code (including the version of JDK used),\n  * credits (acknowledgments to authors of open source reused at least in part for this product) including information such as the name of an author, the name of a reused product and a list of source file names of the reused product,\n  * revision history (a log of changes on the product), \n  * bug report (description of known bugs), and \n  * a listing of other documentation available (below).\n\n**Operation Manual (plaintext or PDF)**\n\nConcise, yet sufficient step-wise explanation about how to start and interact with the program, written for an end user who is concerned with using the program in an application domain (not with the code).\n\n**Reference Manuals (plaintext or PDF, and Javadoc HTML)**\n\nRequirements and design specifications; organization of modules; algorithms and data structures used; functionality of each class or method; etc. A reference manual is written for experienced users and/or programmers who perform various maintenance activities for correction, enhancement, adaptation, etc. Javadoc pages may also be included, and should be included if you intend to have others use your code.\n\n**Testing Document (plaintext or PDF)**\n\nTest plan describing objective(s) of testing, method(s) used for testing, assumption(s) of testing, and hardware/software environment in testing; test case specification describing classification of test cases; test data and I/O of test runs; and whatever else is useful to convince other people about the correctness and good features of your program. **For ICS 311 assignments the testing document will include your conclusions related to the purpose of the assignment.**\n\n### Submission Requirements\n\n  1.

  "## Catalog Description\n\nICS 311 Algorithms (3 credits) Design and correctness of algorithms, including\ndivide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming methods. Complexity\nanalyses using recurrence relations, probabilistic methods, and NP-\ncompleteness. Applications to order statistics, disjoint sets, B-trees and\nbalanced trees, graphs, network flows, and string matching. Pre: 211 and 241,\nor consent.\n\n## SLOs (Student Learning Outcomes)\n\n  * Students are aware of fundamental algorithms of computer science, and their associated data structures and problem solving techniques. \n  * Students can compose a problem formulation of a real-world problem mathematically.\n  * Students can decide whether given pseudocode is correct for a given problem formulation; construct a counterexample if the given pseudocode is incorrect; and outline a proof for its correctness otherwise.\n  * Students can design a correct algorithm for a given problem and describe the algorithm as pseudocode in a given pseudocode syntax.\n  * Students can analyze the worst-case and best-case space and time complexities of a given algorithm.\n  * Students can create a software program for accurately implementing an algorithm specified in pseudocode. Students can implement software objects meeting Abstract Data Type specifications.\n  * Students can produce a software product including documentation for given requirements & design specifications.\n\n_Comment:_ On the fall 2013 final exam one student wrote about a problem:\n\n> \"This question is too hard! We shouldn't have to know implementations we have not used before!\"\n\nI wrote back to thank the student for concisely expressing (the negation of)\nexactly what this course _ is_ intended to teach! You may not \"know\" an\nimplementation you have not encountered before, but this course should prepare\nyou with the tools to analyze and make informed decisions about new\nimplementations.\n\nDo not approach this course solely as a memorization task, where you can only\ndo algorithms you are trained to do, like a circus animal. We do want you to\nlearn a \"catalog\" of algorithms, but you should be understanding their\nanalyses as examples that enable you to analyze unexpected algorithms in the\nfuture. This is essential for being successful in a fast changing field where\n_you_ are expected to figure out whether a new idea will work, as _ you _ are\nthe computer scientist hired to do this.\n\n## Textbook\n\nThomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein,\n[Introduction to Algorithms, Third\nEdition,](http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/) The MIT Press, 2009.\n\nStudents are advised to purchase the textbook, as this book will serve as a\nlifelong reference (it is the second most cited publication in computer\nscience). Also, the exams will be open book but with no electronics permitted,\nso the PDF version of the book won't help you there.\n\nStudents are also advised to keep their ICS 241 (Discrete Mathematics for\nComputer Science) textbooks for reference.\n\n## Instructor\n\n[Daniel D. Suthers](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/)  \nProfessor of ICS\n\n  * Office: POST 309B\n  * Office Telephone: (808) 956-3890\n  * Email: [suthers@hawaii.edu](mailto:suthers@hawaii.edu) (Put \"ICS 311\" in the subject line. Use Laulima for questions that may also apply to other students.)\n  * Office Hours: Mondays 3:00-4:00, or by appointment. (It's best to let me know in advance if you plan to come to office hour. Please don't try to talk to me while I am setting up for class. Brief consultations at the end of class are OK unless I indicate that I need to leave.\n\n## Teaching Assistant\n\nRobert Ward  \nM.S./Ph.D. Student in ICS\n\n  * Office: POST 303 cubicle\n  * Email: [rward@hawaii.edu](mailto:rward@hawaii.edu) (Put \"ICS 311\" in the subject line.)\n  * Office Hours: TuTh 1-2:30 or by appointment.\n\n## Assistant Teaching Assistant\n\nAnthony Sarria  \nICS Undergrad and ICS 311 Survivor\n\n  * Lab: POST 318A\n  * Email: [aksarria@hawaii.edu](mailto:aksarria@hawaii.edu) (Put \"ICS 311\" in the subject line.)\n  * Lab Hours: Mondays 3:15-6:15.\n\n## Communications\n\n**Questions about Course Content**:   In general, questions about course content such as concepts, clarifications of assignments, etc. should be posted to the Laulima discussion forum of the week. This is because (1) other students can see our responses there, and thus also benefit; and (2) other students may notice the question and answer before the instructor or TA notices it (though we will check daily). If you email us a question, we will post the reply in Laulima unless personal information is involved.\n\n**Personal Topics**: For topics that are not of interest to other students or are personal, you may email us, or stop by office hours. (Of course you may also use office hours for course content questions.) If using email, put \"ICS 311\" in the subject line.\n\n**Communication with other students (e.g., group members)**: You can send email to other students in the course using the Laulima \"Mailtool\". You don't need to know their real email address to do this.\n\n##  Online Media\n\nWe use the **course website** [www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/](ww\nw2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311s14/) for posting schedules and notes.\n\nWe use **[Laulima**](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal) for all other online\nrequired course functions such as podcasts, quizzes, discussions and\nsubmitting assignments. Please see [this document on everything Laulima users\nshould\nknow](http://www.hawaii.edu/talent/laulima_tab/tabs/laulima_essentials.html).\n\nWe will use **Google Docs** for in-class problem solving, as it supports\nsimultaneous editing.\n\nScreencasts (videos) of lectures are available on **YouTube** and **iTunesU**\nas well as Laulima (your choice). They are linked from the individual Notes\npages (Topic-XX.html).\n\n",

  "By \"routines\" I mean our periodic patterns of activity: what happens in a\ntypical class, a typical week, and a typical exam and assignment cycle. This\npage tells you what I will do and what you will be expected to do on a\nrecurring basis.\n\n## Exam Cycles\n\nThere are three midterm exams covering the core material. The first two are\ngiven one full week after the last problem set on the exam topics was due, so\nyou have time to get feedback on homework problems. Due to the university\ncutoff for midterm exams, the third is held the week after the relevant topics\nare covered. The first exam is at least half review of 211 and 241: results\nare returned before the withdrawal date so you can assess whether you are\nready for ICS 311.\n\n## Weekly Routine\n\nOn most weeks we cover one book chapter/topic in each of the two classes (two\nchapters per week). The exceptions are the first two weeks when we are getting\nour bearings and covering material that must be understood to comprehend the\nrest of the semester; the weeks we have midterms; and the chapter that\nintroduces graphs (we take a full week for it).\n\nThe pace is intense: set aside time almost every day for ICS 311. The basic\npattern is as follows:\n\n**Saturdays:**\n\n  * Instructor posts any updates to screencasts and notes for the material of the following week by Saturday night, and possibly earlier.\n\n**Sundays:**\n\n  * Projects will be due midnight* on a Sunday night.\n\n**Mondays:**\n\n  * Problem sets from the previous week are due midnight* the Monday after they are given.\n  * Read or review material to understand Tuesday's topic (your choice of my podcasts, my web notes, the CLRS textbook chapter, other readings offered, and/or the MIT lecture videos).\n  * Post any questions you have about the material in the appropriate Laulima discussion forum (instructor will review these after midnight when preparing for Tuesday's class). \n\n**Tuesdays:**\n\n  * The online quiz for Tuesday's chapter is due 30 minutes before class (by 2:30pm).\n  * See \"Class Routine\" below.\n\n**Wednesdays:**\n\n  * Read or review material to understand Thursday's topic.\n  * Post any questions you have about the material in the appropriate Laulima discussion forum.\n\n**Thursdays:**\n\n  * The online quiz for Thursday's chapter is due 30 minutes before class (by 2:30pm).\n  * See \"Class Routine\" below.\n  * Problem sets for the weekend are usually posted Thursday evening.\n\n**Fridays through the weekend:**\n\n  * Use to do problem sets and/or projects in preparation for Sunday deadlines, and to watch screencasts and read book chapters. \n\n  * \"Midnight\": The deadline in Laulima will be set to 23:55 (11:55 pm) on the due date, to avoid any ambiguity of which day \"00:00\" refers to. Upload your solutions before midnight. There will be a 5 minute grace period just in case of network delays. The three projects can be submitted late for 1% off per hour up to 50% off, but the homework assignments cannot be late.\n\nThe Assistant Teaching Assistant will have lab hours on Mondays. This will be\nyour last chance for clarifications before assignments are due. Instructor\noffice hour will be Wednesdays (with some availability Monday by appointment).\nPlan in advance for programming projects due Sundays.\n\n## Class Routine\n\nThe focus of our 75 minute class will be student problem solving in groups,\nwith opportunites to get help. For at least the first part of the semester,\nthe groups will be formed anew _randomly_ each week. Each day you will solve a\nseries of conceptual problems and turn them in as a group for a group grade.\nThese problems prepare you to take on more substantial problems that you turn\nin individually on Sunday. At that time you will also allocate points to group\nmembers. (See [ Assessment](Assessment.html) for explanations of grading.)\n\nHere are typical schedules for 75 minute classes: Adjustments to the class\nroutine will likely be made to meet current needs.\n\n**Tuesdays:**\n\n  * 5: Welcome and Administrative Comments\n  * 5: Icebreaker for new groups (groups rotate weekly)\n  * 5: Solution to previous weekend's homework (if applicable) \n  * 5: Solution to today's quiz. \n  * 5: Introduction to today's problem (including questions submitted in advance) \n  * 45 (or more): Problem solving session, due before end of class.\n  * 5: Brief presentation of class problem solutions \n\n**Thursdays:**\n\n  * 5: Welcome and Administrative Comments\n  * 5: Discussion of Tuesday's problem (if needed) \n  * 5: Solution to today's quiz. \n  * 5: Introduction to today's problem (including questions submitted in advance) \n  * 45 (or more): Problem solving session, due before end of class.\n  * 5: Brief presentation of class problem solutions \n  * 5: Discussion of homework problems \n\nPlan to **bring your laptop or tablet to classes** held in Webster 101 (but\nnot to exams in BusAd A101). You'll need a VGA connector if you want to be\nable to project your laptop to your working group. Apple iPads can connect via\nApple TV. I'm not aware of another method. Of course, groups can function with\nonly one or two members having a projectable laptop, but it's better for you\nif you can be an active participant. At least one person in each group should\nhave the textbook handy in class as well.\n\n##  Other Comments\n\n### Inverted Classroom\n\nThis class is \"inverted\" in the sense that lectures are recorded and made\navailable outside of class, and classroom time is used for what can only be\ndone in person: collaboration and helping each other.\n\nLectures have their advantages, but they have problems too. For most students\nlistening to lectures is too passive an activity. The temptation to daydream\nor check Facebook may be too great, and it takes effort to keep your mind on\nthe material. Actual problem solving is more effective for learning. Also,\nlectures are a form of \"distance learning\": though we are all in the same room\nwe might as well be at a distance, as there is little interaction. When I ask\nworking professionals what skills they want our students to have, being able\nto collaborate in teams is ALWAYS mentioned on the first breath.\n\nFor these reasons, the inverted classroom puts lectures online so that\nstudents who benefit from them can have them, and even review them repeatedly;\nand uses the classroom time in ways that engage students more actively and\ntakes advantage of the unique opportunity provided by being in the same room.\n\n### Studying Before Class and Quizzes\n\nThe online quizzes before class are of course intended to motivate students to\nreview the material before class. There is another motivation: If you don't\nprepare in advance, you risk looking foolish in front of your peers, who may\nbe annoyed at you for being unprepared to help, and you'll miss a learning\nopportunity. You don't want to get a reputation for being the person who is\nnot prepared. It's a small world: someday your peers may be able to influence\nhiring decisions.\n\n### Groups\n\nMuch has been published by researchers and practitioners on how to organize\ngroups for collaborative learning. My approach is based on this research and\nmy experience with this course.\n\nDuring the first month, students will be assigned randomly to groups, rotating\nto new groups each week to help you get to know each other. (A survey of\nstudents fall 2013 indicated that many liked this format as it was a rare\nopportunity to get to know other ICS students.) Also it helps prevent reliance\non dysfunctional relationships (e.g., freeloading and \"the sucker effect\"): a\nstudent can't plan on being with someone who will do the work for him or her,\nand after a while people figure out who to avoid when forming groups.\n\nAfter the Midterm 1 exam, you may form voluntary groups. Students who form\nvoluntary groups will stay in them until the next midterm, at which time they\nmay elect to continue or disband. Other students will continue to be assigned\nrandomly.\n\nRegardless of whether you are in random or voluntary groups, this is an\nimportant opportunity to develop group collaboration skills and also to\ndevelop a good reputation with your peers. It may affect whether you are\nselected to be part of a good group in ICS 311, and I have seen some students\nafter graduation get hired while others fail to get a job because of the\nreputations they had with their peers.\n\n",

  "_These policies were adopted (with changes) from Kazuo Sugihara._\n\nStudents in this course are subject to all the policies of ICS Department and\nthe University of Hawaii at Manoa, including but not limited to the following:\n\n## Cheating\n\nAny form of cheating (such as plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration on an\nassignment) results in the grade of F and will be reported to ICS Department\nfor further actions. In general, I encourage students to help each other but\nyou should each produce your own final version of the homework assignments to\nturn in, except where use of another student's code is explicitly allowed.\nCheck with me if you are not sure.\n\nIn a technical report, a student may quote a few sentences written by another\nauthor with an explicit citation to its original source. Writing sentences or\nideas of the other author without giving credit to the original author is\nplagiarism. Copying content of online documents is also regarded as\nplagiarism, irrespective of how much the original content is modified, if the\nstudent fails to write an accurate citation to the original source. Avoid so-\ncalled \"patchwork plagiarism.\" Informative suggestions are given in [Avoiding\nPlagiarism](http://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/resources/plagiarism/05avoid.htm)\nby Professors Marilyn Bauer and Jacie Moriyama of Leeward Community College.\n\n## Reuse of Open Source\n\nIn a software product for an implementation assignment, a student is allowed\nto reuse open source if ALL of the following are met.\n\n  1. The software does not cover functionality that the assignment specifies that the student will write.\n  2. The software license of the open source reused gives permission for this reuse.\n  3. The license header of reused source code is copied into a source file containing the reused source code.\n  4. Documentation (e.g., Readme, User manual) of the software product clearly gives credits to authors of the reused source code (i.e., acknowledgments to the authors including information such as the name of an author, the name of a reused product and a list of file names of the reused source code).\n\n## Abuse of Facilities\n\nAny form of abuse of computing resources of ICS Department or the University\nof Hawaii will not be tolerated. It results in termination of your account on\ntheir servers any time the abuse is detected, will lead to the grade F, and\nwill be reported to ICS Department for further actions.\n\nPlease keep in your mind that access to and usage of our computing resources\nare your privilege, but not your right.\n\nInappropriate content that may be of an offensive nature to other students\nshould not be displayed on laptops or group workstations during class.\n\n## Makeup\n\nIf a student missed an exam due to illness or injury, a makeup exam will be\ngiven to a student only when the student has a doctor's note dated that day\nand contacts the instructor by email within 3 days after the exam date or the\ndate that the doctor's note suggests the student to recover enough to contact\nthe instructor. However, an ordinary doctor's appointment (scheduled by a\nstudent in advance) is not an acceptable reason for makeup unless it is\ninevitable to conflict with an exam beyond control of the student. The makeup\nexam must be completed before exam solutions are reviewed in class.\n\nFor an exceptional case other than illness or injury, a student must submit an\nofficial document to the instructor providing sufficiently convincing evidence\nof the fact that the cause for missing an exam was beyond control of the\nstudent (e.g., in case of a traffic accident on a way to a class, a police\nrecord of the accident should be furnished).\n\n## Deadlines\n\n**If Laulima or uhunix.hawaii.edu becomes unexpectedly unavailable** in the last several hours before a quiz, homework or project deadline, **_email your solutions to the instructor or TA_** once you are sure that you will not be able to upload it but before the deadline. Please note that some quiz questions use random ordering for multiple choice: specify the content of your response, not just the letter.\n\nThe deadline of every assignment is firm. No late submission will be accepted\n(unless explicitly stated otherwise, possibly with penalties). No extension\nwill be given except the following cases.\n\n  * If Laulima is unexpectedly down for an extended period before the deadline preventing most students from uploading, the deadline will be extended for the downtime. Please notify the instructor of any unexpected downtime when you notice it so that a decision can be made and announced to all students in a timely manner. On the other hand, no extension will be given for scheduled downtime.\n  * A student has a doctor's note dated on the day of a deadline of the assignment and contacts the instructor by email within 3 days after the deadline or the date that the doctor's note suggests that the student has recovered enough to email.\n  * For any other exceptional circumstance other than illness or injury, a student is required to submit to the instructor an official document that is a sufficiently convincing evidence of the fact that the cause for missing a deadline was beyond control of the student.\n\n## Data Backup\n\nEach student is responsible for taking a periodical backup of her/his work and\ncomputer resources needed to meet course requirements. Especially, files for\nassignments should frequently be saved on an external storage device. An\nunexpected failure of the computer is not an acceptable excuse for a late\nsubmission. CS major students should exercise automatic, periodical backup\nprocedures. If you do not practice periodical cloning and backup, start to do\nit from now.\n\nA simple solution is to put all your coursework in a cloud environment such as\nDropbox, but you still need to ensure that you have backup of a working\ncomputer to access this data.\n\nMy own procedure (in OS X) uses two external drives. External drives make it\neasy to move to another computer if yours becomes inoperable. One external\ndrive is about the same size as my internal drive, and I use SuperDuper to\nmake a bootable clone about once a week. This does not save intermediate or\nprevious versions. The other drive is twice the size of the internal drive,\nand I use Time Machine to automatically record previous versions of documents.\nTime Machine does not produce a bootable disk. If my computer failed, I could\nboot off the SuperDuper clone disk and use the Time Machine disk to restore to\nmy most recent versions.\n\nThis is a good procedure for one computer, but the frequency of Time Machine\nruns (once per hour) may be insufficient in time-critical situations. You\nmight manually initiate back up on a more frequent basis. I use four computers\nand a server, so I also use Interarchy to synchronize (via disk mirroring) all\nof my document folders with my server and across the four computers. I run\nsynchronization to my server after each major piece of work.\n\n",

  "## _Part I: Introduction to Analysis_\n\nThis section introduces algorithms as abstractions of programs, and motivates\nwhy we need to do analysis of algorithms rather than just run empirical tests\nof programs. It then introduces some mathematical and conceptual tools for\ndoing analysis. Two useful sorting algorithms are used for illustration; we'll\nreturn to sorting later.\n\n  * **#1** \\- Chapter 1: Introduction to Course Format and to Algorithms \n  * **#2** \\- Chapter 2: Examples of Analysis with Insertion and Merge Sort\n  * **#3** \\- Chapter 3: Growth of Functions and Asymptotic Concepts \n\n## _Part II: Data Structures for Dictionaries & Sets_\n\nIn this section we introduce problem solving and analysis methods (chapters\n3-5), some of which have been covered in ICS 241, and also review review basic\ndata structures and algorithms (chapters 10-12) that were introduced in ICS\n211. The chapters from the text are interleaved and paired up in a manner that\nuses the basic dictionary and set data structures and algorithms to illustrate\nthe problem solving and analysis methods. Hopefully this is mostly review of\nthe two prerequisite courses with some added depth.\n\n  * **#4** \\- Chapter 10: Stacks, Queues, Lists and Trees (Review)\n  * **#5** \\- Chapter 5 and Goodrich & Tamassia section: Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms; Skip list example\n  * **#6** \\- Chapter 11: Hash Tables\n  * **#7** \\- Chapter 4: Divide & Conquer and Associated Analysis Methods\n  * **#8** \\- Chapter 12: Binary Search Trees\n\n## _Part III: Sorting and Balanced Trees_\n\nWe continue into more advanced applications of trees (chapters 6 and 13), also\nproviding the basis for another efficient sorting algorithm. We compare\nadditional sorting algorithms to those from Chapter 2. Sorting is one of the\nmost fundamental and common applications of computers, so efficiency is very\nimportant. We consider the broader question of how fast _any_ sort algorithm\ncan be.

These are covered\nin the text, but we can't fit them all in. Linear Programming will be examined\nbecause it fills out an area not covered well above (numeric algorithms), and\nalso has interesting connections to previous material (e.g., you can solve\nflow problems with a linear program).

We encounter\nthe most important open problem in theoretical computer science (indeed in all\nof mathematics), which is of _practical_ interest because awareness of\n\"intractable\" problems and approximation algorithms could save you\nconsiderable trouble if you encounter one of these very common problems on the\njob!

  "## In Class: Mixing and Matching with `BinarySearch`\n\n####  5 points\n\n**1\\. (1 pt):** The while loop of `InsertionSort` uses a Θ(_n_) linear search to scan backwards through the sorted subarray A[1 .. _j_-1]. Since this subarray is sorted, can we use `BinarySearch` for this search to improve the overall worst case running time of InsertionSort to Θ(_n_ lg _n_)? If yes, argue why the hybrid algorithm would be Θ(_n_ lg _n_). If no, explain why it won't work. \n\n**2\\. (4 pts):** We know from Tuesday's class work that `LinearSearch` is Θ(_n_), so one might think it is always better to use the Θ(lg _n_) `BinarySearch`. However, in order to apply `BinarySearch` we have to sort the data, which (we will soon learn) requires Θ(_n_ lg _n_) time for the best known algorithms (e.g., `MergeSort`). This question explores when it is worth paying this extra cost of sorting the data in order to get fast search.\n\nSuppose you will be **searching a list of _n_ items _m_ times**. When is _m_\nbig enough relative to _n_ to make it worth sorting and using binary search\nrather than just using linear search?\n\nWe have two alternatives. Simply using `LinearSearch` _m_ times on _n_ items\nhas an expected (average) cost of Θ(_mn_). The second alternative is (a)\nbelow, and (b)-(d) explore the tradeoffs.\n\n**a.** What is the expected cost to apply `MergeSort` once to sort _n_ items, and then apply `BinarySearch` _m_ times to _n_ items? \n\n**b.** Suppose _m_ = 1: which strategy is better, and why? Use the above expressions to justify your answer mathematically. \n\n**c.** Suppose _n_ = _m_: which strategy is better, and why? Use the above expressions to justify your answer mathematically. \n\n**d.** What is the cutoff point in terms of _m_ expressed as a function of _n_ between when it is faster to just apply the linear search and when it is faster to apply MergeSort? (Set up an equation and solve for m.) \n\n(Comment: a more accurate analysis would take into account the different\nconstants associated with each algorithm: `MergeSort` has a higher constant.\nBut it can be hard to know the numerical value of the constant to be used in\nthe analysis. So, if you are really concerned about performance, once the\nanalysis gives you the ballpark tradeoff, empirical studies can be used to\ndecide the best cutoff for a given implementation.)\n\n\n",

Peer Credit Assignment\n\n### 1 Point Extra Credit for replying\n\nPlease list the names of the other members of your peer group for this week\nand the number of extra credit points you think they deserve for their\nparticipation in group work on Tuesday and Thursday combined.\n\n  * If three members besides yourself were present at some time, you have a total of 3 points to allocate.\n  * If only two members besides yourself were present, you have a total of 4 points to allocate.\n  * If only one other member was present, you have a total of 6 points to allocate.\n  * You need not allocate all the points available to you. Points allocated to yourself will not be recorded.\n\n## #2. Correctness of `LinearSearch`\n\n### 5 points\n\n**(a)** Show the pseudocode for `LinearSearch` that you will be analyzing. It should be code that you understand and believe is correct, so you may revise your group's solution if you wish. Give each line a number for reference in your analysis.\n\n**(b)** Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties (page 19).\n\n_(This will be a little tricky because the loop can exit for two reasons.\nRather than complicate your invariant trying to cover the two cases, you might\nwrite a simpler one that gets part of the work done, and reason about the two\nexit conditions when you show how the invariant _helps_ to prove\ncorrectness.)_\n\n## #3. Runtime of `BinarySearch`\n\n### 5 points\n\nThis problem steps you through a recursion tree analysis of BinarySearch (the\nalgorithm for searching a sorted array that was reviewed in class) to show\nthat it is Θ(lg _n_) in the worst case (that is, O(lg _n_) in general). Θ and\n\"big-O\" are concepts introduced in Topic 3: if they are not familiar to you,\njust think of this as meaning the longest possible execution on input of size\n_n_ will take time proportional to lg _n_.\n\n**(a)** Write the recurrence relation for `BinarySearch`, using the formula T(_n_) = _a_T(_n_/_b_) + D(_n_) + C(_n_). (We'll assume T(1) = some constant _c_, and you can use _c_ to represent other constants as well, since we can choose _c_ to be large enough to work as an upper bound everywhere it is used.)\n\n**(b)** Draw the recursion tree for `BinarySearch`, in the style shown in podcast 2E and in Figure 2.5. (Don't just copy the example for `MergeSort`: it will be incorrect. Make use of the recurrence relation you just wrote!)\n\n**(c)** Using a format similar to the counting argument in Figure 2.5 of the text or of podcast 2E, use the tree to show that `BinarySearch` is Θ(lg _n_) in the worst case. Specifically,\n\n  1. show what the row totals are,\n  2. write an expression for the tree height (justifying it), and\n  3. use this information to determine the total computation represented by the tree.\n\nSince this problem involves mathematical expressions and diagrams, you may\nwant to do your work on paper and digitize it (please compress images) and\nsubmit as jpg or pdf. Alternatively, use a drawing program.\n\n\n\n",

  "## Homework Problems\n\n_There are 6 problems for a total of 20 points. Most of them are easier than\nthey look at first._\n\n_Please consider:_ The homework is really \"worth\" a lot more than 20 points\nbecause exams have similar problems. If you have not practiced with the\nhomeworks, you'll do worse on the exams. So, if you think these problems are\nnot worth the time for the points, think again.\n\n### #1. Peer Credit Assignment\n\n#### 1 Point Extra Credit for replying\n\nPlease list the names of the other members of your peer group for this week\nand the number of extra credit points you think they deserve for their\nparticipation in group work on Tuesday and Thursday combined.\n\n  * If three members besides yourself were present at some time, you have a total of 3 points to allocate.\n  * If only two members besides yourself were present, you have a total of 4 points to allocate.\n  * If only one other member was present, you have a total of 6 points to allocate.\n  * You need not allocate all the points available to you. Points allocated to yourself will not be recorded.\n\n* * *\n\n### #2. Proving asymptotic complexity\n\n#### 4 points\n\nUsing the truth-condition definition of big-O, prove that 3_n_2 \\+ 9 =\nO(_n_2).\n\n> The definition is the one that starts with \"_f_(_n_) = O(_g_(_n_)) iff ...\".\nYou will have to choose suitable _c_ and _n_0, plug them into the definition\nin \"...\", and argue that the condition is met.  \nThe 4 points are: (1) identification of _c_ and _n_0 that work; (1) writing\nout the definition, and (2) demonstrating that it is satsified as _n_ grows\nbeyond _n_0 (not just for _n_ = _n_0).\n\n* * *\n\n### #3. Relative growth rates of functions\n\n#### 3 points\n\nContinuing in the style of Tuesday's class exercise, fill in the table for\nthese pairs of functions with \"Yes\" or \"No\" in each empty box. Then, for each\nrow, justify your choice, preferably by showing mathematical relationships\n(e.g., transforming one expression into another, or into expressions that are\nmore easily compared).\n\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\n  <caption>\n    Asymptotic Relations\n  </caption>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">f(n)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">g(n)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">O?</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">o?</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">&#937;?</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">&#969;?</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">&#920;?</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">e.</th>\n    <td>4<i>n</i><sup>2</sup></td>\n    <td>4<sup>lg <i>n</i></sup></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">f.</th>\n    <td>2<sup>lg <i>n</i></sup></td>\n    <td>lg<sup>2</sup><i>n</i></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">g.</th>\n    <td>&#8730;<i>n</i></td>\n    <td>n<sup>sin <i>n</i></sup></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n### #4. Complexity of Dynamic Set Operations in List Implementations\n\n#### 2 points\n\nFor each of the four types of lists in the following table, what is the\nasymptotic worst-case running time for `predecessor` and `maximum`?\n\nAssume that _k_ is the key, _d_ the data associated with the key, and _p_ a\nposition in the data structure. This version of the ADT is similar to the\nbook's, but abstracts list elements _x_ to positions (returned by search).\n`predecessor` and `maximum` are with respect to ordering of keys in the set\nunder \"<\", NOT ordering of the data structure. Sorted lists are sorted in\nascending order. This continues your in-class work, which you may want to\nreview for correctness first.\n\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\n  <caption>\n    Worst Case Linked List Operations\n  (continued)\n  </caption>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unsorted, Singly Linked (no tail pointer)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Sorted, Singly Linked (no tail ponter)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unsorted, Doubly Linked with Sentinel and Tail pointer</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Sorted, Doubly Linked with Sentinel and Tail pointer</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\"><i>... others done in class here ... </i></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">predecessor(p)</th>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">maximum()</th>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n\n### #5. Tree Traversals\n\n#### 4 points\n\n_In class you wrote a recursive procedure for traversal of a binary tree in\nO(n) time, printing out the keys of the nodes. Here you write two other tree\ntraversal procedures. The first is a variation of what you wrote in class; the\nsecond is on a different kind of tree that you read about pages 248-249 and in\nmy lecture notes and screencast._\n\n**(a)** Write an O(_n_)-time **_non-recursive_** procedure that, given an _n_-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node of the tree in whatever order you wish. Assume that trees consist of vertices of class `TreeNode` with instance variables `parent`, `left`, `right`, and `key`. Your procedure takes a `TreeNode` as its argument (the root of the tree). **_Use a stack as an auxiliary data structure._**\n\n>     printBinaryTreeNodes(TreeNode root) {\n\n\n**(b)** Write an O(_n_)-time procedure that, given an _n_-node rooted tree with **_arbitrary_** number of children using the **_left-child, right-sibling representation_**, prints out the key of each node of the tree in whatever order you wish. Assume that for economy of code we are re-using our `TreeNode` class. The instance variable `left` points to the left child as before, but now `right` points to the right sibling instead of the right child (which is no longer unique). Your procedure takes a `TreeNode` as its argument (the root of the tree). You may choose to use either the recursive or non-recursive approach.\n\n>     printLCRSTreeNodes(TreeNode root) {\n\n\n### #6. A Hybrid Merge/Insertion Sort Algorithm\n\n#### 7 points\n\nAlthough MergeSort runs in Θ(_n_ lg _n_) worst-case time and InsertionSort\nruns in Θ(_n_2) worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort\n(including that fact that it can sort in-place) can make it faster in practice\nfor small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to\n**_coarsen_** the leaves of the MergeSort recursion tree by using\nInsertionSort within MergeSort when subproblems become sufficiently small.\n\nConsider a modification to MergeSort in which _n_/_k_ sublists of length _k_\nare sorted using InsertionSort and are then merged using the standard merging\nmechanism, where _k_ is a value to be determined in this problem. In the first\ntwo parts of the problem, we get expressions for the contributions of\nInsertionSort and MergeSort to the total runtime as a function of the input\nsize _n_ and the cutoff point between the algorithms _k_.\n\n**(a - 1pt)** Show that InsertionSort can sort the _n_/_k_ sublists, each of length _k_, in Θ(_nk_) worst-case time. To do this:\n\n  1. write the cost for sorting _k_ items with InsertionSort,\n  2. multiply by how many times you have to do it, and \n  3. show that the expression you get simplifies to Θ(_nk_).\n\n**(b - 3pts)** Show that MergeSort can merge the _n_/_k_ sublists of size _k_ in Θ(_n_ lg (_n_/_k_)) worst-case time. To do this: \n\n  1. draw the recursion tree for the merge (a modification of figure 2.5), \n  2. determine how many elements are merged at each level, \n  3. determine the height of the recursion tree from the _n_/_k_ lists that InsertionSort had already taken care of up to the single list that results at the end, and \n  4. show how you get the final expression Θ(_n_ lg (_n_/_k_)) from these two values. \n\n_**Putting it together:**_ The asymptotic runtime of the hybrid algorithm is\nthe sum of the two expressions above: the cost to sort the _n_/_k_ sublists of\nsize _k_, and the cost to divide and merge them. You have just shown this to\nbe\n\n> Θ(_n__k_ \\+ _n_ lg (_n_/_k_))\n\nIn the second two parts of the question we explore what _k_ can be.\n\n**(c - 2pts)** The bigger we make _k_ the bigger lists InsertionSort has to sort. At some point, its Θ(_n_2) growth will overcome the advantage it has over MergeSort in lower constant overhead. How big can _k_ get before InsertionSort starts slowing things down? Derive a theoretical answer by proving the largest value of _k_ for which the hybrid sort has the same Θ runtime as a standard Θ(_n_ lg _n_) MergeSort. This will be an upper bound on _k_. To do this: \n\n  1. Looking at the expression for the hybrid algorithm runtime Θ(_n__k_ \\+ _n_ lg (_n_/_k_)), identify the upper bound on _k_ expressed as a function of _n_, above which Θ(_n__k_ \\+ _n_ lg (_n_/_k_)) would grow faster than Θ(_n_ lg _n_). _Give the _f_ for _k_ = Θ(_f_(_n_)) and argue for why it is correct._\n  2. Show that this value for _k_ works by substituting it into Θ(_n__k_ \\+ _n_ lg (_n_/_k_)) and showing that the resulting expression simplifies to Θ(_n_ lg _n_). \n\n**(d - 1pt)** Now suppose we have implementations of InsertionSort and MergeSort. How should we choose the optimal value of _k_ to use for these given implementations in practice? \n\n",

  "# Indicator Random Variable Analysis\n\nUse indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of _n_\nrolls of a fair dice that has _s_ sides. A fair dice can have values from 1 to\n_s_ with equal probability. Do it in these steps, and answer the numbered\nquestions:\n\nDefine the _indicator_ random variable _X__i_ = I {the event of a dice coming\nup with value _i_}, for each _i_ = {1, 2, ... _s_}.\n\n**1.** What is Pr{_X__i_ = 1} for each i? \n\n**2.** What is E[_X__i_]? In other words, the expected value of _X__i_? \n\nDefine the _regular_ random variable _X_ to be the value of a single roll of a\ndice with _s_ sides.\n\n**3.** Write an equation expressing _X_ in terms of _X__i_.   _(Keep in mind that indicator random variables take on values 0 or 1.)_\n\n**4.** Take the expectation of both sides of this equation and solve for E[_X_], the expected value of _X_.   _(Show all steps, like was done in the derivation of the expected number of inversions.)_\n\n**5.** Use the result to write an expression for the expected value of _n_ rolls of an _s_-sided fair dice. \n\n# Additional Activity\n\nIf you finish the above early, this will get you started on future work.\n\nSuppose I assigned the _n_ students in a class randomly to groups, with no\nconstraint on group size, but I decided in advance to have _n_/4 groups.\n\n**6.** Let's pick two students from our class. Call them Michael Jackson and Bruno Mars. What is the probability that Michael and Bruno end up in the same group? Express as a function of _n_. \n\n\n",

  "# Analysis of data structures\n\nThis week's problems focus on ensuring you understand the operations of the\nmain data structures. They are not conceptually difficult but require\ndilligence in execution. Don't be careless or just go on intuition: you should\nactually follow the algorithms and hash functions precisely, or you will go\nwrong.\n\n## Peer Credit Assignment\n\n**(1)** Please list the names of the other members of your peer group for this week and the number of extra credit points you think they deserve for their participation in group work on Tuesday and Thursday combined.\n\n  * If three members besides yourself were present at some time, you have a total of 3 points to allocate across all members (_NOT_ 3 points per member!).\n  * If two members besides yourself were present, you have a total of 4 points to allocate across all members.\n  * If only one other member was present, you have a total of 6 points to allocate across all members.\n  * You need not allocate all the points available to you. Points allocated to yourself will not be recorded.\n\n## Skip Lists\n\n#### 11 points\n\nPlease read carefully; this has multiple parts. Answer the lettered parts in\nboldface.\n\nHere is a skip list, including instance variables **s** (the starting\nposition), **h** (the height: we assume that `h` starts counting from 0), and\n**n** (the number of keys currently stored in the skip list). We won't bother\nto show the data associated with the keys. The double lines in the graphic are\nmeant to remind you that these are doubly linked lists in both the horizontal\nand vertical directions, but you need not draw double lines in your responses.\n\n![](/morea/data/6.hash-tables/starting-skip-list.jpg)\n\n**(2)** _Trace the path that `SkipSearch(36)` takes, by circling every node that p is assigned to as the `SkipSearch` algorithm executes, starting with s. _\n\nIn the remaining questions, you will how what the skip list shown above looks\nlike after the cumulative operations indicated below, using the pseudocode for\n`SkipInsert` and `SkipSearch` in the lecture notes, and your understanding of\nhow `SkipDelete` works from the class activity.\n\nSince this is a random algorithm and we want everyone to have the same answer\nto facilitate grading, I also give you sequences of random numbers (not all of\nwhich will be used, as I am testing your understanding of when and how the\nrandom numbers are used). Note that the insertion code says ` while\nrandom(0,1) ≤ 1/2 do`...\n\nThe operations are **cumulative:** each step builds on the result of the\nprevious one. Redraw the entire data structure after each operation, and also\nupdate instance variables **s**, **h** and **n** as needed.\n\n**(3)** _Redraw after `SkipInsert(19,data)`_ where `random(0,1)` returns .70, .94, .14, .11, .89, ... \n\n**(4)** _Redraw after `SkipInsert(53,data)`_ where `random(0,1)` returns .14, .51, .22, .68, .45, ... \n\n**(5)** _Redraw after `SkipInsert(32,data)`_ where `random(0,1)` returns .25, .39, .18, .97, .02, ... \n\n**(6)** _ Redraw after `SkipDelete(SkipSearch(15))`. _\n\n_Something to think about (but not graded): What should the list look like if\nwe now deleted 32? There is a choice to be made here that we have not\ndiscussed! _\n\n**(7)** _Now draw what an _empty_ skip list would look like, including s, h and n._\n\n## Hashing\n\n#### 9 points\n\n###  Hashing with Chaining\n\n**(8)** _Show the table that results when 20, 51, 10, 19, 32, 1, 66, 40 are cumulatively inserted into an initially empty hash table of size 11 with **chaining** and **_h_(_k_) = _k_ mod 11.**_ _Draw this one with a vertical table indexed from 0 to 10, and linked lists going off to the right, as shown._\n\n![](/morea/data/6.hash-tables/hash-chaining-template.jpg)\n\n###  Open Addressing with Linear Probing\n\n**(9)** _Show the table that results when 20, 51, 10, 19, 32, 1, 66, 40 are cumulatively inserted into an initially empty hash table of size 11 with **linear probing**_ and\n\n> h'(k) = k mod 11  \nh(k,i) = (h'(k) + i) mod 11\n\n_Draw this and the next result as horizontal arrays indexed from 0 to 10 as\nshown below. Show your work to justify your answer to the next question!_\n\n![](/morea/data/6.hash-tables/hash-open-template.jpg)\n\n**(10)** _How many re-hashes after collision are required for this set of keys?_ _ Show your work here so we can give partial credit or feedback if warranted._\n\n### Open Addressing with Double Hashing\n\n**(11)** _Show the table that results when 20, 51, 10, 19, 32, 1, 66, 40 are cumulatively inserted into an initially empty hash table of size _m_ = 11 with **double hashing**_ and\n\n> _h_(_k_,_i_) = (_h_1(_k_) + _i__h_2(_k_)) mod 11  \n_h_1(_k_) = _k_ mod 11  \n_h_2(_k_) = 1 + (_k_ mod 7)\n\n_Refer to the code in the book for how i is incremented. Show your work to\njustify your answer to the next question!_\n\n![](/morea/data/6.hash-tables/hash-open-template.jpg)\n\n**(12)** _How many re-hashes after collision are required for this set of keys?_ _Show your work here so we can give partial credit or feedback if warranted._\n\n**(13)** Open addressing insertion is like an unsuccessful search, as you need to find an empty cell, i.e., to _not_ find the key you are looking for! If the open addressing hash functions above were uniform hashing, _ what is the expected number of probes at the time that the last key (40) was inserted?_ _Hints: At that point, 7 keys are in the table. Use the theorem for unsuccessful search in open addressing._ _Answer with a specific number, not O or Theta._\n\n    \n",

  "# Deletion under Open Addressing\n\nFollowing the directions below, write pseudocode for `HASH-DELETE` to delete\nby writing a special `DELETED` value, and modify `HASH-INSERT` to handle the\n`DELETED` value. You will write your response in the exact same form as the\nbook's pseudocode (shown).\n\n**1.** Write `HASH-DELETE` by renaming `HASH-SEARCH` and adding or changing ONE line in the body.\n    \n    \n    Hash-Search (T,k)  // rename to Hash-Delete and remove this line \n       i = 0\n       repeat\n           j = h(k,i)\n           if T[j] == k\n               return j\n           i = i + 1\n       until T[j] == NIL or i == m\n      return NIL\n    \n\n**2.** Write the new `HASH-INSERT` by changing only ONE line in the following. \n    \n    \n    Hash-Insert (T,k)\n       i = 0\n       repeat\n           j = h(k,i)\n           if T[j] == NIL\n               T[j] = k\n               return j\n           else i = i + 1\n       until i == m\n       error \"hash table overflow\" \n    \n\n**3.** What is the Θ runtime complexity of the worst case for the modified `HASH-INSERT` and `HASH-DELETE` in terms of _n_ (number of elements stored) and _m_ (table size)? (_ Describe the worst possible situation. Express its runtime with Θ. _) \n\n### Deletion from Skip Lists\n\n![](/morea/data/6.hash-tables/SkipList-Small.jpg)\n\n`SkipSearch(k)` returns a pointer `p` to the bottom most element of the tower\nyou want to delete. Suppose this were passed to a method `SkipDelete(p)` −\nnotice it takes `p` as argument, not `k`. In this problem you analyze the\ncomplexity of `SkipDelete`. Before you start the analysis, you should discuss\nhow it works! Then, if you have time, you can write pseudocode for it for\nextra credit.\n\n  * Assume that a skip list node has fields `p.next`, `p.prev`, `p.above` and `p.below`.\n  * Assume that `SkipInsert(k,d)` has built the skip list using `random(0,1)` with cutoff of 0.5. \n  * The delete procedure climbs the tower of linked lists above `p`, doing repeated deletion from each doubly linked list that the element occurs in. \n\n**4.** Assuming a uniform distribution of keys stored in random order, what is the Θ expected case performance of `SkipDelete` in terms of _n_, the number of keys stored in the skiplist?\n\n**5.** What is the probability that a given call to `SkipDelete` would have to _delete at least _k_ nodes_? (_Hint: Think of the probability that SkipInsert builds a \"tower\" of _k_ nodes for a given key._) \n\n#### Extra Credit\n\n**6.** If you finish early, write the recursive pseudocode for `SkipDelete(p)`. \n\nHint:\n    \n    SkipDelete(p)\n    if p ≠ null {\n    // splice out of this doubly linked list\n    // recurse to splice out of list above\n    }\n    \n",
